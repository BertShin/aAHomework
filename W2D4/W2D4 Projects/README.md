# Sick-Day 1 Projects


During Sick-Day 1, I went over the lecture slides and took my own
notes on Big O albeit I missed a lot of good insight via questions
from the cohort, I'll be sure to bring my own questions about Big O
(specifically space complexity) when I arrive tomorrow.


I was able to complete:

  1) CSS Advanced Selectors Exercise
  2) Execution Time and Differences/Algorithms
  3) Anagrams
